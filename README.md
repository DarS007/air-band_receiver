If you are a maker and enjoy constructing various DIY electronic stuff, you perhaps consider building one of air-band receiver kits available in Chinese e-shops. These kits are around 10-15 USD, including PCB and all components (**NE602** mixer, **MC1350** IF amp, **LM358** opamps, etc.). Bargain. And a lot of pleasure (as well as self-education value) from listening to the 118-136MHz AM band not available on commercial radios.

The kit has been reviewed by multiple people, including:

Be aware, however, that the kit is **more difficult to assemble than you might think**. Attached guide summarizes our experience with this DIY air-band receiver and includes some enhancements.

Enjoy! Happy building! And don't forget - apart from the radio receiver, you **NEED a decent antenna**!

PS. Big thanks to Chinese makers who produce these affordable kits!
